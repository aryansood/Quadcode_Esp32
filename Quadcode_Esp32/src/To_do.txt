Order of prociding:
- Kalman filtering Code
- Communication simple one
- Simple control
- Communication complex one
- Complex control

Kalman Filter:
- Use of acc and mag as measurement matrix. 

Matrix:
- All definition will be done outside to prevent memory leak.


List in order:
- Check if vector code+quaternions+Matrix is working without problem.
- Matrix operation code
- First thingh is calibration.
- Complete Kalman Filter
- Do a full state estimation
- Communication part
- Rtos Task creation and division
- Manual control code
- Control algorithm
- Advance autonomous controller 



BMP388:
- Sensor Calibration
- Sensor Testing
- Converting raw data to readable

LSM6DSM:
- Check if there is some calibration to do
- Sensor testing

LIS2MDL:
- Check how to calibrate
- Sensor Testing
- Converting raw data to readable

BMP388:
- Sensor Testing 

Filtering Kalman:
- Start to implement a kalman filter
- Check how to
- Check how to determine covariance matrix
- Filter Testing

Parameter Estimation:
- Found ways for Parameter estimation
- Check if it reasonable to implement

Simple Control:
- Do a simple quadcopter movement up and down, left and right

Communication:
- Do a simple data transfer using just the simple esp32 wifi module to see if quadcopter
  fly.
- Check how to implement protocols
- Creating ground station for data collection
- Check if control commands are sent correctly

Complex Control:
- Something to do at last
- Start creating a simulation environment
- Tune the parameters

Physics Quadcopter:
- Create Pdf with the equation of motion of Quadcopter
- See if it possible to use quaternions or euler angles are sufficient
- Linearitation and everythingh else
