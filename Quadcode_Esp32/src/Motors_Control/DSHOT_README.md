# Dshot Protocol Implementation
Here it is an explanation on how to implement Dshot protocol on esp32.
I have referenced to a few explanation: \
https://github.com/derdoktor667/DShotRMT \
https://brushlesswhoop.com/dshot-and-bidirectional-dshot/ \
https://github.com/Marian-Vittek/raspberry-pi-dshot \
The code of the first implemntation did not worked, there were some timing issues that I will show how to resolve.
